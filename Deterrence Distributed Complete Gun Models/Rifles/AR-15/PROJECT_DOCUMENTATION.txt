This is, and has been, a massive project.  Lots had to be done to get this model to spec.

But, as a result of much labor, many late nights turned early mornings, and plenty of deliberation, we have what we believe
to be the most accurate complete 3D AR model in existence.  Manufacturers may have model of some parts or even the complete model, but they won't share. 
Our goal is to spread this as wide as possible.  If someone had the means, we believe every part in this assembly could be made
and assembled into a working firearm.

This isn't the end of this endeavour - we still need to do rifle-length parts, Pmags, potentially an A1/A2 upper, and having
a dynamic model (so you could play with springs) which would be nice as well.

We had to create many parts from scratch and also created blue print accurate parts based on the models in the previous DD AR-15.  
Everything in this assembly is believed to be good by us since most of the parts are dimensioned after original blueprints or were dimensioned after our own physical AR-15 parts.  

Included is the model in different formats as well as the springs, for example the magazine spring in uncompressed form which you could use to wind your own mag spring to the correct dimensions.
It is worth mentioning that the sub assemblies included in the .step format model are not congruent to the origin of the main assembly . The main assembly is fine, however.

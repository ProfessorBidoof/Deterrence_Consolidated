					            Corrected AR15 Model 
						    Detailed Change Notes
================================================================================================================================

Many parts had to be created from scratch because the original 3D model parts were so incorrectly dimensioned and modeled that it wasn't possible to just modify them. 
Quite a few parts were actually non-existent in the original AR-15 model and thus had to be made from scratch as well. These follwing parts had to be heavily modified to result in blueprint accurate or at least functional parts.
